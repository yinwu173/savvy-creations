# Creating My Portfolio

## About the Project

* This project aims to display my portfolio which samples the work I have done. It is used for hiring managers to determine whether or not I am a good candidate for the open position. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done once the viewer is presented with a page that shows my name, a recent photo, links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

* It is done once the navigation links scrolls to the corresponding sections.

* It is done when the section about my work has titled images of my applications.

* It is done when my first application is larger in size than the others.

* It is done when the image is clicked, it takes you to the deployed application.

* It is done when my portfolio adapts to different viewports.
